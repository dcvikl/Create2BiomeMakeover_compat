# Create to Biome-Makeover Compatibility Datapack Mod

I like the Ancient Oak from Biome-Makeover, but I coudn't process it in my Lumber Yard. So I made this little Datapack Mod.

As a bonus, this will also give the Tree Bark from FarmersDelight-Refabricated:

1. when processing Ancient Oak Log to Wood you get 2 Bark
2. when processing Ancient Oak Log to Stpipped Log you get 4 Bark
3. when making Planks feom the Log you get 4 Bark and 6 Planks
4. when making Planks from Stripped Log or Wood you don't get the Bark again since it is already stripped ...
